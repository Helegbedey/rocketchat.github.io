    It requires no technical knowledge about managing and securing servers, we take care of that got you, and
    can be completed in a couple of minutes.

    We perform 24x7 monitoring on every instance and have configured hundreds of safety alerts to keep your team chat secure and fast.
    Your data up is backed-up up to every hour, to give you peace of mind in the case of an emergency.
