<h1>Team</h1>

<p>
  What started simply as a proof of concept code published to GitHub almost
  two years ago has exploded into the ever-evolving open source platform
  Rocket.Chat is today. While we have the developer community as a whole to
  thank for that, our core team members have worked zealously to spur on growth
  and keep Rocket.Chat always aimed towards the next level. Get to know each of
  them below.

  {% for member in site.data.team %}

    <div style="background-image: url('{{ site.url }}/images/team/{{ member.name | slugify }}')/small.png"></div>
    <h3>{{ member.name }}</h3>
    <p>{{ member.title }}</p>
    <p>{{ member.department }}</p>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
