      What started simply as a proof of concept code published to GitHub almost
      two years ago has exploded into the ever-evolving open source platform
      Rocket.Chat is today.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we have the developer community as a whole to
      thank for that, our core team members have worked zealously to spur on growth
      and keep Rocket.Chat always aimed towards the next level. Get to know each of
      them below.
