        In 2015 we were using OpenFire (XMPP) as our communication tool.
        We were frustrated with the lack of dedicated and supported clients for mobile, web and desktop.
        We found Rocket.Chat while searching for alternative open source communication tools.
        It was love at first sight! Rocket.Chat works on all platforms, in real-time with a full searchable chat history.
        We also discovered and implemented LiveChat on our site which brought our team chat to other departments and our community.
