_This series of blog posts will share the [Google Summer of Code](https://rocket.chat/docs/contributing/google-summer-of-code) projects that our 2018 cohort of students are working on. Community members are encouraged to join them in creating and testing these exciting new areas of features.<br/>Each project will have their open source repository listed.  Please feel free to drop in and say hello, or join in the action with your own issue or code contribution.<br/>_

## Improving user interactions in Rocket.Chat - Speech to text integration
**Student: Karan Bedi <br/> Mentors: Gabriel Delavald, Pierre Lehnen**

Welcome back to our 2018 GSoC blog series! Up next is Karan's project that aimed to develop a voice recognition and speech to text integration features to connect some of the well-known voice recognition/speech to text APIs currently on the market directly to Rocket.Chat from within. It also aimed to integrate open source speech with text engines for users who prefer an on-premise, full-featured installation.

### Improving communication on the go

The project came about through a request made by a Rocket.Chat collaborator who uses the platform a lot while driving or on the go and so often does have the time to rely on typing a message, instead relying on sending audio messages. Noisy environments can make this difficult and so a solution was mooted.

The speech-to-text technology native to some devices allowed them to resolve part of the issue, however moving the technology to reside within Rocket.Chat itself would enable this solution to be used by everyone.

A solution for the request has been found in the form of this current implementation, in which the team have used the Google Voice API to communicate what the recorded message sent by the user says, the engine then decodes the audio and translates it into text, all within a matter of seconds. The bonus is that Google Voice API is easily replaceable as it can be swapped for other engines like IBM Watson or Bing Speech API because they all work almost the same (you send audio, they return text).

### Improving UI

This project aimed at improving both UX and UI by configuring the API/engine’s connection and usage attributes, and giving Rocket.Chat’s UI the ability to click a button, record a message, send to the desired API/engine and return the results to the Rocket.Chat editing message box. In short, users will now experience a fast, in-platform speech to text experience that facilitates user multi-tasking or those who do not wish to type their messages because they are busy doing something else, as per the original collaborator's request.

### Overcoming some technical challenges

Speech to text is a technology that has gained popularity recently, with some providers like Google, Microsoft and IBM improving their engines and providing some open APIs to translate audio files into textual content. However, since this is pretty new, there are still some challenges when trying to work with different providers, like different encodings and file formats that are expected on different APIs.

Our idea was to provide an easy way to connect different speech-to-text solutions to Rocket.Chat. Currently we have only implemented the Speech-To-Text feature using the Google Speech API, but it is easily replaceable with other engines such as IBM Watson or Bing Speech API; we will investigate these other solutions at a later date.

We are carrying out a review to make sure everything works properly but hope to go live with this feature towards the end of September to accompany that release.

### About the creator: Karan Bedi

Karan Bedi is an undergrad student pursuing a major in Applied Mathematics at IIT Roorkee.
In his own words:
> Programming, good food, music and travelling are what get me going. My areas of interests are financial mathematics, numerical analysis, machine learning and natural language processing.

Karan says that taking part in GSoC 2018 with Rocket.Chat over the summer has been 'one of the best experiences' of his life and has found it particularly rewarding as it was his first ever contribution to an open source project. Karan now wishes to pursue contributing to open source software and hopes to become an increasingly active member of the OSS community.

Any parting thoughts Karan?

> I sincerely thank the org members for their continuous support in project and non-project related matters.

Great news! Thank you for your contribution to Rocket.Chat this summer!
