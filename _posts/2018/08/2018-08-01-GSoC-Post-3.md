## Improving user interactions in Rocket.Chat - Speech to text integration
**Student: Karan Bedi    Mentors: Gabriel Delavald, Pierre Lehnen**

Welcome back to our 2018 GSoC blog series! Up next is Karan's project that aimed to develop a voice recognition and speech to text integration features to connect some of the well-known voice recognition/speech to text APIs currently on the market directly to Rocket.Chat from within. It also aimed to integrate open source speech with text engines for users who prefer an on-premise, full-featured installation.

The project started from an issue on GitHub, which then graduated to the ideas list for Google Summer of Code. This is where it was picked up and it has since been brought to life over the summer.

### About the creator: Karan Bedi

Karan Bedi is an undergrad student pursuing a major in Applied Mathematics at IIT Roorkee.
In his own words:
> Programming, good food, music and travelling are what get me going. My areas of interests are financial mathematics, numerical analysis, machine learning and natural language processing.

Karan says that taking part in GSoC 2018 with Rocket.Chat over the summer has been 'one of the best experiences' of his life and has found it particularly rewarding as it was his first ever contribution to an open source project. Karan now wishes to pursue contributing to open source software and hopes to become an increasingly active member of the OSS community.

Any parting thoughts Karan?

> I sincerely thank the org members for their continuous support in project and non-project related matters.

Great news! Thank you for your contribution to Rocket.Chat this summer!
