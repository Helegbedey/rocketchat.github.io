## Contributor spotlight

[Artur Rymarz](https://github.com/artrmz) and [Luca Zimmerman](https://github.com/soundstorm) are our featured contributors for this release. Thank you both for such great work on your PRs and tests.

## Edit & Delete a message

Now you can long press a message of yours to edit the text of it, respecting the settings of the server you're connected to. Depending on the server settings, the user will be able to always edit their own message, or only before a certain amount of time, or the edit will be always disabled.

To delete a message we the user also needs to long press a message and if the option is available on that message (it also depends on a few settings) the user will be able to delete the message. The action can result in two different situations: when the message is complete deleted or the message simply changes the type and shows a system message *Message removed*. This is also a setting on the server.

## Autocomplete of emojis

In your text field, simply type `:` and the following letter of the emoji you want, and the app you show you the related emojis while you type. We always show all the matching emojis, so you the user type `:ro` we'll show the `:rocket:` ðŸš€ emoji but also the `:broccoli` ðŸ¥¦. Super handy!

## Support all authentication methods

YAY!!! We know a lot of our users were requesting this support and we finally did it! Now you can connect to Rocket.Chat using any of our authentication methods that we support on the web. The methods introduced on this update were: GitHub, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, CAS and SAML. We also improved our custom OAuth support fixing some small issues.

## Deeplink support

Now the iOS app supports deeplink integration, with the ability to connect to a new server and open a chat directly from a link. If you want to read more about this, you can follow this documentation. //TODO: Link to docs

## Change the icon of the app

This is a nice feature if you want to choose a different icon color to look nicer in your home screen. You've lots of different colors here and we'll certainly going to add more options in future releases. If you've any suggestion of colors/styles, just send us the artwork or [open an issue](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.iOS/issues) in our GitHub repository.
