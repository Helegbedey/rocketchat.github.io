## Obrigado! (Thank you!) Rocket.Chat Summit 2018, Bonito, Brazil

![Rocket.Chat Team, March 2018](/images/posts/2018/04/2018-04-18-rocket-chat-summit-2018/Summit-2018-Team-Photo-1.jpg)

In March this year, Rocket.Chat’s 41-strong team and significant others
travelled to Bonito in Brazil’s Mato Grosso do Sul for its 2018 Summit,
a week-long adventure filled with incredible activities, company-wide
meetings and, most importantly, the chance to spend time together.
