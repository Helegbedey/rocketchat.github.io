LONDON, United Kingdom - October 22, 2018 -- The Open Source Initiative (OSI), the founding organization of the open source software movement, announced Rocket.Chat has continued its support for the global non-profit as a Corporate Sponsor. Rocket.Chat joins Craigslist Foundation, Facebook, Github, Google, Heptio, HPE, IBM, USB Direct, and many more sponsors, supporters and members committed to increasing awareness of open source software, and participation within the innovative communities that enable its continued advancement.

"We're very excited to announce Rocket.Chat's sponsorship, not only because of their generous financial support, but also because they'll be providing access to the Rocket.Chat platform itself in support of our Incubator Projects and Working Groups," said Patrick Masson, OSI General Manager. "The OSI community is highly distributed, and access to a collaboration platform like Rocket.Chat will help our community organize, co-create and manage the very important work underway to increase the understanding and adoption of open source software."

The OSI provides opportunities and resources—web hosting, wikis, mailing lists, etc.—for open source advocates to self-organize around affinity issues and projects. These "Incubator Projects" are dedicated to addressing a specific need of, and for, the open source community in line with the OSI's mission of education and advocacy while building bridges among different constituencies. Incubator projects focus on the creation of resources for open source communities, development practices, licensing or any other non-code aspect of the open source ecosystem. With the addition of Rocket.Chat as a Premium Corporate Sponsor, another valuable tool has been added to the resources the OSI can provide Incubator Projects to help advance the open source movement.
