Rocket.Chat is proud to announce a new release of its Android native application, version 2.6 now.

Highlights include:

- Added support to Admin panel if youâ€™re admin (see in left sidebar menu);
- Added support to custom emojis;
- Added support to German, Ukranian and Japanese languages;
- Added support to Rich Messaging;
- Upload/Reset your avatar;
- Updated app icon;
- Fixed tons of bugs and crashes;
- Now you can use the app without Google Play Services (FOSS);

### Admin Panel

If you've access to the admin panel in the server you're logged in, you can now access it directly from your Android device by going to the left-side panel and opening the "Admin panel" item. We're releasing a new version of our core (0.69.2) that fixes some bugs related to the mobile usage on it, please make sure you're up to date with that before trying the admin in mobile ðŸ™ˆ.

### Update your avatar

It's possible now to update your avatar by taking a new photo, choosing a picture from the photo library or even clearing your avatar if you want to.

Now you have access to all your custom emojis directly from the emoji keyboard and soon to also react to a message!

### FOSS

This is a long time feature request to our Android app ([issue number 26!!!](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Android/issues/26)) and was finally accomplished with a huge help from [@Bubu](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Android/pull/1232) and [@luciofm](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Android/pull/1585). Bubu is now working to send the FOSS release to the F-Droid store and soon you'll be able to install directly from there. Until then, you can download the APK file and install directly on your device by looking into the assets of [our releases](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Android/releases/tag/v2.6.0).
