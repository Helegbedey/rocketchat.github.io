Rocket.Chat is delighted to announce that its Zapier App is out of beta and is now public, allowing you to connect your app to 1,000+ other integrations via Zapier!

Using Zapier allows you to use Rocket.Chat as your primary communication hub by connecting the platform with all of your most valued resources and useful web applications such as Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub,and Twitter.

Thank you to everyone who helped us out during the beta phase! As a result, we were able to squash bugs, resolve issues and reach a sufficiently stable Zapier App for public release.

## Reminder: What is Zapier?

[<strong>Zapier</strong>](https://zapier.com/apps/rocketchat/integrations) is an online tool that helps all of your applications work together by automating repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration.

A Zap is an automated workflow that connects two or more apps; when something happens in one application, an action is triggered in another, meaning they are composed of a trigger and a resulting action. Zaps can be as simple or as complicated as you need them to be.

Zapier provides an incredibly flexible and powerful infrastructure that makes connecting Rocket.Chat to other applications easy and intuitive.

## The best apps, brought together

Improve your productivity by automating your work using the Rocket.Chat Zapier integration's triggers and actions. Move info between Rocket.Chat and your other web tools automatically, so you can focus on your most important work. It's easy enough that anyone can build their own app workflows with just a few clicks.
