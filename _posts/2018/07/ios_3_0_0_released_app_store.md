Dear Rocket.Chat community,

We’re proud to announce a new release of our iOS native application, version 3.0.0 now. We’ve been working on this update for months already and we think you’re going to love it!

# A major redesign on the experience

We completely redesigned the experience you have when you open the iOS application. Now, the first thing you see is the list of chats sorted by activity (more on that later) and the access to all the information is easier than ever! To open a new chat, you simply tap on it on the list, very simple.

## Offline first, connection status should not be intrusive

Having a reliable internet connection will always give you the best experience using the app, but we know that this is not always possible and sometimes we need to using the app on the airplane or in-between very unstable connections.  We believe your experience should not be affect by this, so we changed the way the app handles the internet connectivity. Now when the app is waiting for a connection, you’ll see a small text on the title of the view saying the currently state, but you can still navigate in the app and send text messages while offline.

Also, if you were connected until you received couple of messages, if you loose your connectivity, you can still read the entire message when you enter in the room. We believe this change will provide a smoother experience for your on the daily basis.

## Servers selection is more visible

# Theming

Yes!!! Now you can choose between light, dark and black themes. This project was developed by Samar Sunkaria during the GSoC project 2018. We choose this options of themes because we think it’s gonna look amazing on your iPhone and iPad, specially the black theme for the iPhone X users. Samar will keep working on more themes, more improvements on the app and a few integrations between the mobile apps and the server (needs to rephrase this).

# User Details screen

Now you can see all detailed information about an user: timezone, roles, name, status and more! You can even start a new conversation with a user by pressing the "Message" button below the avatar.

# Sorting & Grouping

With all this layout changes, we thought we had to include the option for you to sort the list by activity or alphabetically and to group it by type, group your favorites and show the unread chats on the top always. The default experience we believe is the best for you on the mobile is no grouping at all an sorting by activity, but you’ve now the option to choose between all this.
