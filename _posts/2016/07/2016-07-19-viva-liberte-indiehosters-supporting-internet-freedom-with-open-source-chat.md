One of the most rewarding developments for our team over the past year has been the success of [IndieHosters](https://indiehosters.net/), a company that exists largely to help organizations achieve more freedom and individual security.

![](/images/posts/2016/07/viva-liberte-indiehosters-supporting-internet-freedom-with-open-source-chat/pierre%20ozoux.jpg? "Pierre Ozoux.jpg") This week, we spoke to [Pierre Ozoux](http://twitter.com/pierreozoux), the Co-Founder of IndieHosters and a devops based in Lisbon, about why and how Rocket.Chat has been instrumental in their mission.

**Hosting Open Source Chat as a Service**

One of the hurdles that those unfamiliar with open source have to overcome is learning and configuring the necessary pieces for hosting our platform. While it's well worth the time it takes to do so, some organizations and businesses might not have that time: enter IndieHosters.

IndieHosters offers [Rocket.Chat hosting as a service](https://indiehosters.net/shop/product/rocket-chat-21), making it extremely simple for organization and companies to set up their own, white label version of Rocket.Chat, using their own branding, rules, bots, etc. They help other companies get over the hump of installation, wiring the DNS, hosting behind TLS, managing updates, etc. - and this is extremely important, because these are the reasons why many companies who would otherwise go open source end up sticking with proprietary software.

Rather than overpaying for the proprietary version, IndieHosters makes it possible to save money while also getting the tech support needed to host your own company collaboration platform.

This is a particularly valuable aspect for organizations or companies that need a secure end point, where they can download all organizational data at any moment: IndieHosters has it covered. This gives you a lot of freedom, because if you at any point decide to end your IndieHosters service, you can take your data and go without a hitch.

"We believe the world would be a better place if every web app was available as a service," says Pierre. "You should be able to get that service in a click, and to end that service in a click if you wish to do so."

Pretty amazing.

**Internet Freedom and Open Source**

If you want to understand the relationship between open source and internet freedom, [Pierre writes a blog on the subject](https://pierre-o.fr/). A key point for Pierre and many others is that Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) is extremely important.

IndieHosters uses Rocket.Chat both as the primary collaboration tool within their company and to help power the Internet Freedom revolution, hosting the [#nuitDebout](https://chat.nuitdebout.fr/) chat earlier this year. ( [Nuit Debout](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/08/nuit-debout-protesters-occupy-french-cities-in-a-revolutionary-call-for-change) can be compared to the Occupy movement in the United States and to Spain's anti-austerity 15-M or Indignados movement).

"A week after the beginning of the movement we were contacted to see if we would be willing to host a free chat for the movement, which was being partly hosted on Slack at the time," Pierre explains. "We didn't hesitate. After configuring  the dns, the chat was up and running immediately."

But of course, there's more to the story! Like many of our now-contributors, Pierre originally got in touch with us about a specific project — really [just to ask a question](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/205) — and in a matter of days jumped onto the team to help make us [the official Docker application](https://twitter.com/RocketChatApp/status/631928175652679680).

"It was a unique experience, being welcomed like that into a new community," Pierre told us later. Now the Rocket.Chat application on Docker has 129 stars and 500k+ downloads — not too shabby!

**Rocket.Chat-Powered Collaboration**

From a practical perspective Rocket.Chat, being a leader in FLOSS collaboration platform, was the obvious choice for Pierre. IndieHosters uses our platform within their own team and to power the live chat on their website as well as offering it as a service.

"As a hoster, I tried various systems in order to find the best one to offer our users," says Pierre. "Without question Rocket.Chat is the best. I love the fact that I have all the groups I belong to in one place, and that I can have an OTR discussion — the latter is extremely useful for high-security moments like sharing passwords with users, for example."

"Best of all, when I have an issue, I can go to GitHub and get it fixed, usually within the week." It helps too, he adds, that the documentation is well done, making integrations easy.
