If you ever wondered where Rocket.Chat came from, [this is the article](http://osdelivers.blackducksoftware.com/2016/06/14/rocket-chat-hosted-chat-services/) you need to read! It covers everything from the moment when CEO Gabriel Engel realized there was a real need for a livechat platform that facilitated internal and external communication, to the company's plans for the future. Some of the incredibly innovative projects that our users are building with Rocket.Chat are discussed too. A world of possibilities has been opened up for our users, we're excited to see what you all come up with next!
