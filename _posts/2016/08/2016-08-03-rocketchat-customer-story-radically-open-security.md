### Instant Communication in a Radically New Business Model

Radically Open Security is the world's first non-profit computer security company. With 90 percent of profits going to a charity that supports an open internet, the founders couldn't be more serious about the principle of an open information society. So, when this globally distributed organization was looking for a secure solution for their communication needs, the only choice was an open source IM platform. That's where Rocket.Chat came in.

### Why Give 90 Percent of Your Profits to Charity?

Radically Open Security co-Founder John Sinteur is one of those rare businesspeople who put principles before profit. There aren't many people who can say they give 90 percent of their profits to charity. There are even fewer who do this, and can afford to pay competitive wages to their team.

How does he do it? It's a combination of the innovative business model and the impeccable service Radically Open Security provides to their customers. Amsterdam-based John Sinteur explains that the business model uses "a Dutch "Fiscaal Fondswervende Instelling" (Fiscal Fundraising Institution) to provide a commercial front-end that sends 90% of the organization's profits tax-free to a backend foundation (Stichting NLnet) that has supported open-source, Internet research, and digital rights organizations for almost 20 years".

The security company's idealism fuels its growth. Look at its team members and it is quickly clear that Radically Open Security's principles have made it an attractive employer for like-minded high achievers and industry experts. There is even a group of volunteers who are happy to share their time and expertise free of charge.

### "How could we possibly use anything BUT open source ourselves?"

Given their commitment to an open internet, it was vital for Radically Open Security to find a communications platform that adhered to their principles. As John Sinteur asks: "How could we possibly use anything BUT open source ourselves?"

When John and his colleagues were searching for an instant messaging platform that met their requirements, they spent a considerable amount of time looking for open source chat tools that were secure and extensible.

It was also important for the computer security consultancy company to find a communications tool that facilitated easy integration with their other projects. In particular, Radically Open Security uses GitLab, Kanboard and Hubot. Of course, their ideal tool needed to integrate with everything they write themselves. Rocket.Chat ticked all the boxes and the team hasn't looked back.

Today, John reports: "We simply integrate Rocket.Chat with whatever we need at the time we're doing a project." It couldn't be easier.

### Announcing the Live PenText Demo

Rocket.Chat is now an integral part of Radically Open Security's globally distributed workplace. It has been a part of a new OWASP project that will shortly be made public. Their latest project, PenText, is a fully open-sourced XML-based pentest document automation system.

John explains: "We're about to give a demo of the automation framework that supports the entire pentesting lifecycle: from the initial inquiry, through pentest scoping, quotations, pentesting, and reporting, through the final invoice. Rocket Chat is part of that."

Co-founder and CEO Melanie Rieback and lead pentester Peter Mosmans are looking forward to demonstrating and explaining the architecture behind the OWASP PenText system live at BSidesLV 2016\. This system can be used to manage the entire lifecycle of pentesting data, including the automatic generation of documentation at various points in the process (including quotations, pentest reports, and invoices). They will also be discussing their larger Pentesting ChatOps infrastructure, which includes Rocket.Chat, Hubot, and GitLab.

### Working Together with Rocket.Chat

Co-founder John has been pleasantly surprised by the swift responses of the Rocket.Chat development team: "RocketChat is one of the most active and responsive dev teams I've seen in a loooooong time."

Radically Open Security self-host Rocket.Chat on virtual machines. Given the confidential nature of Radically Open Security's client data, they cannot be in the cloud. However, the team have observed a few areas where there could be potential for a leak. They create GitHub issues for the Rocket.Chat team every time they run into any.

John lists easier collaboration and a faster turnaround on projects where a lot of things can be automated away as metrics that have also impressed him and his colleagues.

Are there any features he would like to request? He's way ahead of us, answering: "None that aren't already a GitHub issue!"

### Conclusion

Globally distributed non-profit computer Radically Open Security needed an instant messaging platform that corresponded with their firmly held principles. As a secure, responsive open source tool, Rocket.Chat was clearly the best choice for the Amsterdam-based security consultancy company.

Rocket.Chat integrates easily with whatever project they happen to be working on; in fact, it has been an integral element of their latest project, PenText. Enjoying a good relationship with the Rocket.Chat development team, this security consultancy is enjoying the many benefits of working with a like-minded open source company.
