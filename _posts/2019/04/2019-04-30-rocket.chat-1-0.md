For four years Rocket.Chat team has been building a proof-of-concept. One that actually works, used by more than 25 million users worldwide, on more than 350 thousand servers. Today we are proud to announce the release of our first ever LTS version, 1.0. It has been a long journey since May 2015, when we released Rocket.Chat on GitHub. From a humble CRM module to a fully-featured chat platform, used by millions of users, huge communities and enterprises, we've learned a lot. The developers community has been an essential part of our success in creating a better, decentralized future where everyone's privacy is respected without sacrificing innovation and technology.

During those years, we have gone through many changes. We have grown our core-team from just a few developers to more than thirty employees (including some from the community) and we have heavily invested in UX, mobile apps, and many other exciting features.

### Whatâ€™s new?

So what is version 1.0 all about? Here are some of the most exciting features we shipped with version 1.0:

#### Threads

Have you ever been lost in a chain of replies that only seems to get more confusing the more you go back in? Threads are the solution you are looking for. Keep your replies organized and read them sequentially. Check the GIF below to understand how this changes the way you've been using replies:

#### Discussions

Have you ever felt the need to take part of a conversation away from the main stream of messages to be able to focus on what's being discussed? Look no more! Discussions is the feature for you. You start a discussion from a single message, and that becomes a separate room which everyone can be part of. Check out the following GIF for an example of how to use it:

#### Federation

You know how easy it is to send an e-mail to someone at another company? Wouldn't it be nice if you could also chat with them? Well, now you can! Rocket.Chat Federation allows servers to communicate with each other. When you enable Federation, your server becomes part of the Rocket.Chat Federated Network, which allows it to find and exchange messages and files with other Federated Rocket.Chat servers. Find out more about how to enable Federation on your Rocket.Chat server by reading [its documentation](https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/federation).

#### Livechat

Version 1.0 brings a totally new,  revamped, lightweight Livechat UI. It's been rewritten in Preact, improving usability, performance and scalability.

Take a look at how Livechat has changed:
