Today we are happy to announce the new release of the Rochet.Chat+ Desktop App, version 2.9.0 for Windows, Linux and MacOs; bringing our users new features and much anticipated fixes. All the new Desktop Apps are available for download immediately.

This new version brings a large number of improvements, from easier deployment for companies to better notifications. We aimed to improve the apps incrementally by fixing bugs and implementing some widely requested usability features.

Mac users will notice the missing Services menu has been added to the app and that they are now able to answer messages directly from the notification alert. Also on notifications, Windows users will not be bothered by duplicate notifications anymore and won't have to wonder why the app window didn't open when you opened the app.

For those who deploy the apps to multiple users, we have added server default configuration file, where administrators can pre-define the list of servers for all users in the system.  In addition, we have added a rocketchat:// protocol handler, so now you can share server urls with users and it will get added to their app server list once opened, this will work for messages inside the Rocket.Chat+ app and for your website as well, as long as they have the app installed.
