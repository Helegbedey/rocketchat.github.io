It is no secret that education systems across the modern world are running behind the times.  Regional governments around the globe have education reform and modernization on their agenda, but often fall short on execution due to bureaucratic resistance, lack of expertise and vision.

### Empowering teachers to inspire their students

Ricardo Garcia (University of Tampa) saw an opportunity to make a positive change in improving and modernizing education and co-founded Classuite LLC to fast-track this radical vision. 

> "Classuite's mission is to empower teachers with technology to inspire and motivate their students.", says Ricardo. "At Classuite we believe that technology can inspire students to do incredible things. Better classrooms create more engaged students, and more engaged students become the next generation of leaders and innovators. We want to provide the technology to empower teachers and students across the world." 

### Modernizing the educator's tools  

![](https://cdn-my.konecty.com/rest/image/outer/1/200/rocketchat/BlogPost/24/images/classuiteiphone3.jpg? "classuiteiphone.jpg")Existing educational tools are often archaic, complex, and don't create true connections. They actually seem to make education more difficult. Email isn't much better, since students prefer to spend hours looking at social media or chatting on their smartphones. Instant messaging is the way of the future for them. 

Look at the growth of messaging apps over the last few years--companies like Skype, HipChat, and Slack are changing the way that stiff corporate  environments communicate and collaborate. Up until Classuite, no one has attempted to bring this kind of technology-driven changes to the world of education.

### Imagining the platform for the future of education

Being a student at The University of Tampa, Ricardo was able to understand the importance of communication and collaboration in the learning process. Current educational tools do not facilitate clear and instant communication between students and their teachers. Most educational platforms are complex and students don't like them.  

Yet on the other hand, Ricardo sees that students spend hours on their smartphones communicating the way they love most: through instant messaging. That's when it clicked for Ricardo : 

_Why not bring that same communication pattern to the classroom environment!?_

Thus the idea for Classuite was born - a technology platform that allows teachers and students to communicate in the most personal way they know, by chatting to each other.  

Classuite improves the way teachers share ideas with their students. The user-friendly platform allows teachers to upload resources, share important documents, stream live lectures, and get students engaged. At the same time, students can submit assignments, ask questions, and collaborate in groups. The entire class is searchable in seconds, from any device.

### Extending a powerful and feature-rich chat system

To build the Classuite platform, Ricardo and his team needed to create or extend a powerful chat system with rich features.After some research, their team naturally gravitated towards open source and Rocket.Chat.

"The number one feature of Rocket.Chat that our team needed is the chat itself. Our entire platform is based on a chat, because that is how we communicate these days. Every educational feature that we build is built on top of the chat.",according to Ricardo.

Throughout 2016, the Classuite and Rocket.Chat teams have been collaborating together to build the system.

### Dawn of a new era for Education: Classuite launches 2017

The first version of the Classuite platform launched on January 3rd 2017 and it is currently being used by teachers and students from universities across the US, including The University of Tampa, Florida International University, Florida Atlantic University, Savannah College of Art and Design.
