Open source software, like Rocket.Chat, can reduce licensing fees, time and cost to develop software. Classuite used Rocket.Chat's mobile SDKs, customized the UI and features to rapidly and affordably create their classroom chat product for teachers and students.

## Custom Rocket.Chat user interface

Classuite created a custom theme with bold colors and more spacing. They customized the right sidebar by removing advanced features, giving teachers and students easy access to essential actions like searching for users, viewing profiles and shared resources. The result is a clean and simplified user experience, which is easy to learn but still lets students and teachers communicate and collaborate in real time.

## Chatrooms as classrooms

Chat channels have been renamed as classes and are private by default. Only teachers can create a class which they invite students to join with a unique code generated by Classbot. Modifying Rocket.Chat's privacy features enabled Classuite to create a secure space that is only accessible to teachers and students.

## Classuite's custom Chatbot

Classbot is a custom chatbot that greets users and introduces Classuite. Personalized user interactions show teachers how to create their first class. Students are encouraged to begin collaborating with peers through private and group messaging. Joining a new community can be challenging but Classbot explains where to begin and next steps to take.

## Messaging within private and small groups

Classuite used Rocket.Chat's existing private and group messaging features to create a safe workspace. Shy students can answer a question by privately messaging their teacher instead of speaking in front of their whole class. As Joaquin Traverso, Classuite's Head of Development explains: 

> _“We want everyone - especially the students, who are oftentimes nervous or shy about expressing their opinions and experiences - to feel comfortable discussing their ideas, knowing that only their classmates and teacher will have access to the conversations.”_

## Mobile Apps using SDKs

Rocket.Chat's mobile SDKs provide a set of software development tools that enable businesses like Classuite to add a real-time chat backed by a Rocket.Chat server to native Android and iOS apps. SDKs save both development time with an API and dozens of hours on app integration.

## What next for Classuite and Rocket.Chat?

> _“Rocket.Chat made it possible for us to reach unforeseen development speed. We knew what we wanted to achieve with our product but we didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so relying on open-source software with a superb community has proven to be one of the best decision we have made yet.”_ - Joaquin Traverso

Classuite are creating a custom mobile app (available in January 2018) built with Rocket.Chat's mobile SDKs to power chat and adding custom features such as private workspaces, push notifications and file sharing.
