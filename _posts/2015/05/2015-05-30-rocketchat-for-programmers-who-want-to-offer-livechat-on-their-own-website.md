This [article](http://wwwhatsnew.com/2015/05/30/rocket-chat-para-los-programadores-que-quieran-ofrecer-un-chat-en-su-web/) was published in the early days of Rocket.Chat, when we were still on the first version and had just 1,000 users chat at the same time. But, some things haven't changed - we still are and always will be open source, developers can still contribute on GitHub, and our platform is still beautifully simple and clean.
