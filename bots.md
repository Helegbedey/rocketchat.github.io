      <h2>Features and roadmap</h2>
      <p>
        Rocket.Chat has supported bots since the beginning, with our internal Hubot and adapter, enabling chat-ops workflows with multi-channel, multi-user, public and private interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re pushing that forward now with new headline features and a roadmap of priority issues that will unlock the potential for community contributions.
