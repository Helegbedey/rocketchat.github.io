    We implement state of the security on Rocket.Chat Cloud.
    Every cloud instance runs in it's own set of Docker containers with it's own database - isolated from other cloud instances.
    Under the hood day-today database operations are performed with restricted users to minimize risk.
    We perform 24x7 monitoring on every instance and have configured hundreds of safety alerts to keep your team chat secure and fast.

    giving you affordable and scalable team chat solution for tens of thousands of users.

    giving you the most flexible affordable enterprise team chat solution.
