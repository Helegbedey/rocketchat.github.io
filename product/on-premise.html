        I found Rocket.Chat when I was looking for an application that solved
        our problems with the our old instant messaging solution. I installed it
        in less than 5 minutes on one of our servers and since then our
        communication problems have been resolved. The platform is exceptional!
        Safe, fast, easy to use and with excellent support from the developer team and community.
